# Assignment
A Testing Automation Application.

			A Simple Demo of Test Automation

Info: This application is basically based on AngularJS, SASS Compiled CSS, HTML5 & Grunt for Task Automation.

Note: This App is crossbrowser oriented and works above IE8 as angular js isn't stable on IE8 as per Google.

					To Run

1. Download the build(.zip). 
 	
2. Install Node.JS:                               						https://nodejs.org/

3. Place it into the default drive(e.g. C:
) & Navigate to the 'Assignment-master' Folder using node.js command prompt as an administrator.

4. Type the command "npm install" without inverted commas and weight till all the dependencies are installed.

5. Type the command "grunt" without inverted commas and weight till the application gets hosted on the localhost:3000 into the default browser in a sync mode.

Note: This application is under development and SCSS files will not be present in the project, since the CSS is compiled into app.css.
